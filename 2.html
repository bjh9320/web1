User stylesheets are an exciting feature of Cascading Style Sheets(CSS). In CSS, thepresentation of a document is controlled by the combination of userand author style preferences. This mechanism is needed[text only]to allow CSS to describe fully (and then extend) the current behavior ofbrowsers. Early implementations of CSS did not support userstylesheets. However, newer browsers, such as MS Internet Explorer 4.0+, Opera 3.50+, and hopefullyNetscape Navigator 5.0 (based on the Mozilla project) all support userstylesheets. The interaction of user and author stylesheets requires stylesheetsto be well behaved in certain ways. The main purpose of this documentis to explain what a good user stylesheet is. I will also try tocomment on what good author stylesheets are. Some of this discussioninvolves discussion of specific properties, while some is more general.Finally, I will address bugs in browsers' handling of user stylesheets. Since user stylesheets have not been used very much, many of thecomplex issues of good style are not fully understood. Here Ipresent my opinions on good style. These may change as I and othersunderstand more about cascading. Some people have argued that authorstylesheets should specify all styles relevant to the layout of thedocument, since author and user stylesheets cannot interactgracefully. (See, for example, BradenMcDaniel's post in c.i.w.a.s.)By traditional design standards, this may be the best solution.However, I think the cascade can lead to attractive design (althoughprobably not as good as complete author control or complete usercontrol) and certainly to more usable presentation of information. This guide assumes prior knowledge of CSS. If you don't already knowthe basic syntax of CSS, you will probably have trouble understandingthis guide. If you don't know CSS yet, I recommend one of the many tutorials on CSS.Furthermore, this guide isn't very practical, in that some of itsadvice conflicts with workarounds needed to avoid triggering bugs in older browsers.
